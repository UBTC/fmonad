# MONADIC

This is my [xmonad window manager](http://xmonad.org/) configuration, the core of which has been heavily used for years.

## Installation

1. Install the required applications:

    `xmonad, lxde, firefox, gmrun, scrot`, [suckless-tools](http://tools.suckless.org), [neovim](https://neovim.io/), [roxterm](http://roxterm.sourceforge.net/) and [fish](http://fishshell.com/).

2. Backup the previous configurations:

    `mv ~/.xmonad ~/.xmonad.backup`

3. Clone this configuration:

    `git clone 'https://github.com/mogeiwang/monadic' ~/.xmonad`

4. Recompile xmonad:

    `xmonad --recompile; xmonad --restart`

5. That's all, have fun!

[From `\retired`, you can find my previous configurations for using xmonad with taffybar.]
